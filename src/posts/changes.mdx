This week is going to be my last week before graduation. I still have to take one exam and do a presentation, but college is now almost over. I think that this is the biggest change in my life since moving away from my parent's house back in 2021. 
<br/>

Feels weird, to be honest.
<br/>


Iâ€™ve been trying to understand this weird feeling for the past couple of days, but I haven't succeeded at all. One hypothesis that I have is that, as I illustrated in [Glasses](https://www.gustavofior.com/blog/post/glasses), Iâ€™ve spent way too much time without changing my glasses or discovering new worlds in my life's videogame and this is causing this sensation. If this is the case, then Iâ€™m the one to blame for this weird (not in a positive sense) feeling. Maybe Iâ€™ve been in my comfort zone for a little too long. 
<br/>


I have the impression that the older you become, the less big changes happen, but I'm not sure if this happens in everybodyâ€™s life or if itâ€™s happening with me just because I haven't created these changes.
<br/>


Hereâ€™s another thing that I don't fully understand about life yet: am I supposed to be constantly changing environments and creating big changes for growth to occur (like I mentioned in [Glasses](https://www.gustavofior.com/blog/post/glasses)) or is it okay to be a little slow sometimes? Whatâ€™s the ideal path? Do I need to mix both, i.e. be slow in some areas and constantly pursue changes in others? 
<br/>


So many questionsâ€¦ I wonder when Iâ€™ll get to these answers.

### Cool stuff I've come across

As always, read a [great essay](http://paulgraham.com/hwh.html) by Paul Graham about working hard. His take on why is so hard to measure how hard youâ€™re working when explicit goals are not imposed is something I feel daily.

Found this cool [tool](https://nous.fyi) for bookmark search and had a nice chat with the founder. Shoutout to [Siddharth](https://twitter.com/sidbing)!

Read a wonderful [essay](https://daneden.me/blog/2012/constraints-affordances) by Dan Eden. This part stuck in my head:
<br/>


> *The imperfections are a mark of our craft. We donâ€™t have that on the web. There are no happy accidents. No overexposures. Mistakes are logged in version control, or comments, but quickly shooed away. Weâ€™re not brave enough. We strive too hard for perfection. Constraints encourage bravery and amplify value. Remain mindful of the decisions you make - and most importantly, the mistakes you make.*
