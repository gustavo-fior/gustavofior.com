Hey! This is my home on the internet... welcome :)

This project is part of an attempt for me to step out of my comfort zone and start to learn more about front-end development.

I've been coding backend apps for the most part of my life and want to try new stuff. 

If you have some ideas, comments, want to reach out or just spotted some bad code, please create an issue or send me message on [Twitter](https://x.com/heyimgustavo).

Byeee :)
